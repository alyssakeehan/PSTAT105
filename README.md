# PSTAT105

This is a repo of all my assignments for PSTAT 105: Non Parametic Statistics
In this class, I learned more about non parametic statistics like Chi Squared Tests, Kolmogorov-Smirnoff tests, Kernel Denisty Estimates, Local Linear Regression and Histograms.
All of my work was completed using RStudio.
